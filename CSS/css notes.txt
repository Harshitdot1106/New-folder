Here are the main components of the CSS box model:
Content: The actual content of the HTML element, such as text, images, or videos.
  The size of the content can be controlled using the height and width properties.
Padding: The space between the content and the border of the element.
 Padding can be set for all sides or for each side individually.
 The background color set for the content also applies to the padding area
Border: The border that surrounds the content and padding.
 Borders can be set for all sides or for each side individually
 Borders can be styled with various properties such as color, width, and style.
Margin: The space between the border of the element and the adjacent elements.
  Margins can be set for all sides or for each side individually.
 The background color set for the content does not apply to the margin area.
 Margins for two elements can overlap, and collapses to the larger value and they        dont apply to span 
 MArgin syntax   margin:top right bottom left ;
so as to avoid the img to strech we can use object fit cover
to show two divs side by side we use display:flex
